# MMGPA
The Pytorch Implementation of our proposed MMGPA model will be released on June 15, 2023.

We now present the MMGPA experimental logs to facilitate the evaluation of the validity of the experimental results.

MMGPA's experimental logs on each dataset are named after the dataset name. For example, the content in `Clothing.txt` indicates the MMGPA experiment log on the dataset Clothing under the optimal hyperparameter settings.
